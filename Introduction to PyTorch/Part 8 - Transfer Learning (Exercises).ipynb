This layer was trained on the ImageNet dataset, so it won't work for our specific problem. That means we need to replace the classifier, but the features will work perfectly on their own.

You can move them back from the GPU with `model.to('cpu')` which you'll commonly do when you need to operate on the network output outside of PyTorch.
