Neural networks with non-linear activations work like universal function approximators. There is some function that maps your input to the output. For example, images of handwritten digits to class probabilities. The power of neural networks is that we can train them to approximate this function, and basically any function given enough data and compute time.\n","\n","<img src=\"assets/function_approx.png\" width=500px>\n","\n","At first the network is naive, it doesn't know the function mapping the inputs to the outputs. We train the network by showing it examples of real data, then adjusting the network parameters such that it approximates this function.\n","\n","To find these parameters, we need to know how poorly the network is predicting the real outputs. For this we calculate a **loss function** (also called the cost), a measure of our prediction error. For example, the mean squared loss is often used in regression and binary classification problems\n","\n","$$\n","\\large \\ell = \\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_i^n{\\left(y_i - \\hat{y}_i\\right)^2}\n","$$\n","\n","where $n$ is the number of training examples, $y_i$ are the true labels, and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted labels.\n","\n","By minimizing this loss with respect to the network parameters, we can find configurations where the loss is at a minimum and the network is able to predict the correct labels with high accuracy. We find this minimum using a process called **gradient descent**. The gradient is the slope of the loss function and points in the direction of fastest change. To get to the minimum in the least amount of time, we then want to follow the gradient (downwards). You can think of this like descending a mountain by following the steepest slope to the base.\n","\n","<img src='assets/gradient_descent.png' width=350px>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Nerp-p5AtKeQ","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Backpropagation\n","\n","For single layer networks, gradient descent is straightforward to implement.

Finally we calculate the loss $\\ell$. We use the loss as a measure of how bad the network's predictions are. The goal then is to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the loss.\n","\n","To train the weights with gradient descent, we propagate the gradient of the loss backwards through the network.

Through the `nn` module, PyTorch provides losses such as the cross-entropy loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`). You'll usually see the loss assigned to `criterion`. As noted in the last part, with a classification problem such as MNIST, we're using the softmax function to predict class probabilities. With a softmax output, you want to use cross-entropy as the loss. To actually calculate the loss, you first define the criterion then pass in the output of your network and the correct labels.\n","\n","Something really important to note here.

This raw output is usually called the *logits* or *scores*. We use the logits because softmax gives you probabilities which will often be very close to zero or one but floating-point numbers can't accurately represent values near zero or one ([read more here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html)).
